# Predicting-House-Prices
# California Housing Price Prediction

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `Untitled0.ipynb` that demonstrates how to build a regression model to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset. The notebook performs the following tasks:

- Loads the California Housing dataset.
- Prepares the data by splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Trains a linear regression model.
- Evaluates the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Provides visualizations of the model's predictions.

## Files

- **Untitled0.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook that contains the complete code and steps for predicting house prices using linear regression.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you'll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- The following Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChakraborttySouvik/Predicting-House-Prices/
Install the required Python libraries:

code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Usage
Start Jupyter Notebook:

code
jupyter notebook
Open Untitled0.ipynb from the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.

Results
The notebook trains a linear regression model on the California Housing dataset and evaluates its performance. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the model is reported, which provides insight into how well the model predicts house prices. The notebook also includes visualizations comparing actual and predicted prices.
